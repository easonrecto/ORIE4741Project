  The quality of wine can be measured in many different ways. Master sommeliers rate wine quality based on sight, smell and taste and give incredibly detailed reviews about them. The amount of labor put into the viniculture and viticulture of the wine is reflects quality in the price. From a purely physical standpoint, quality can be determined based off of the grape varietal and region of origin. Taking all of these characteristics into account, we would like to create a model that can predict how good a wine is.
  In order to predict wine quality, we will take into account the following features: points, variety, description, country, province, region 1, region 2, winery, designation, and price. These features will be used to predict characteristics such as rating, price, or even the location and varietal as a sommelier would. Additionally, we will gather data about the conditions in these specific regions to make predictions about the future of wine vintages where we could propose pricing strategies to wineries.
